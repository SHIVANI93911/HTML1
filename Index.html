            <p>A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out sequences of arithmetic 
               or logical operations (computation) automatically. Modern digital electronic computers 
               can perform generic sets of operations known as programs. These programs enable computers 
               to perform a wide range of tasks. The term computer system may refer to a nominally complete 
               computer that includes the hardware, operating system, software, and peripheral equipment needed
                and used for full operation; or to a group of computers that are linked and function together, such 
                as a computer network or computer cluster.A broad range of industrial and consumer products use comp
                uters as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls are 
                included, as are factory devices like industrial robots and computer-aided design, as well as general-
                purpose devices such as personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. Computers power the Internet, 
                which links billions of computers and users.</p><hr>
